Vehicle one (V1-case vehicle), a 2001 Volvo V70, 4-door station wagon was traveling east in the eastbound through lane of a three-lane, two-way urban road (one eastbound lane, one eastbound left turn lane, and one westbound lane) and was entering a four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Pontiac Aztec, utility vehicle was traveling south in the southbound through lane of the three lane, two-way, intersecting road. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in a T-type configuration. The impact caused V1 to be redirected to the right and V1 departed the southeast corner of the intersection. The front of V1 struck and knocked down a breakaway traffic control post and came to rest in a residential yard. V2 continued forward and reportedly rotated counterclockwise 200 degrees and came to rest in the right northbound lane facing northwest. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 67-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag, seat-mounted air bag, and roof-rail mounted side impact curtain air bag deployed. He was taken via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center and hospitalized with critical injuries. The 53-year-old female right-front passenger (non-case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center where she was treated and released with minor injuries (MAIS-1, ISS-2).

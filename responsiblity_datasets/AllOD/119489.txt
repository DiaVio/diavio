Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1999 Chevrolet Malibu, 4-door sedan was stopped in the mouth of a commercial driveway facing west, waiting to make a left turn onto a north-south two-lane, two-way road. . Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Saturn Ion, 4-door sedan was traveling north in the northbound lane of this two-lane, two-way roadway and was approaching the commercial drive that V1 was exiting. It was daylight, snowing, and the bituminous road was icy. The driver of V1 reportedly did not see V2 and began to enter the roadway with the intention of turning left. As V2 traveled north, V1 entered the north-south road and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in a T-type configuration. There was no physical evidence of the impact or final resting positions at the scene or on the police-accident report. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 88-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available 3-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and was later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center. She was the lone occupant of V1.
